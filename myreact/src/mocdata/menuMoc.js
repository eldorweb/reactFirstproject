            ing: "Eggs, Fresh lettuce (for garnish), Salt, Cooking oil (vegetable or olive oil), Optional spices: black pepper, paprika, or chili flakes",
            prep: "To prepare fried eggs, start by heating a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a teaspoon of cooking oil and let it warm for about 30 seconds. Gently crack the eggs into a small bowl one at a time to ensure no shell fragments are present, then slide them into the pan. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and any optional spices like pepper or paprika. Let the eggs cook undisturbed until the whites are fully set but the yolks remain runny for a sunny-side-up style. If you prefer over-easy, flip the eggs carefully with a spatula and cook for another 10-15 seconds. Serve on a plate garnished with fresh lettuce for added color and a crisp bite.",
            benefit: "Fried eggs are a powerhouse of nutrition. Packed with high-quality protein, they support muscle repair and growth. They’re also an excellent source of vitamins like B12 and D, which enhance brain function and bone health. The addition of lettuce not only adds fiber but also antioxidants, aiding digestion and boosting your immune system. Opting for olive oil instead of butter can increase heart-healthy fats, making this a nutritious and delicious option for breakfast or brunch."

            ing: "Pre-made or homemade pizza dough, Tomato sauce (preferably fresh or organic), Mozzarella cheese, grated,  Slices of ham or Canadian bacon,Pineapple chunks, fresh or canned, Olive oil, Oregano or Italian seasoning (optional)",
            prep: "Begin by preheating your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness, then transfer it to a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread an even layer of tomato sauce across the surface, leaving a small border for the crust. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese generously over the sauce. Arrange slices of ham evenly, followed by pineapple chunks for that sweet and savory combination. Optionally, sprinkle oregano or Italian seasoning for added flavor. Drizzle a little olive oil on top for a golden finish. Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. Serve hot.",
            benefit:"Hawaiian pizza combines the sweetness of pineapple with savory ham, creating a balanced flavor profile. Pineapple is rich in vitamin C and bromelain, an enzyme that aids digestion and has anti-inflammatory properties. Tomatoes in the sauce provide lycopene, a powerful antioxidant supporting heart health. The cheese offers calcium and protein, essential for bone health. By moderating portion sizes, this dish can be both indulgent and nutritious.",
